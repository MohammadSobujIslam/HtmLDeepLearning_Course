    <p style="font-size: 25px;">
        How Does it Work?<br>
        With HTML image maps, you can create clickable areas on an image.<br>

        The idea behind an image map is that you should be able to perform different actions depending on where in the image you click.<br>

        To create an image map you need an image, and some HTML code that describes the clickable areas.<br>
        Try to click on the computer, phone, or the cup of coffee in the image below:<br>

<h1>Physics History</h1>
        <p>he Western Roman Empire fell in the fifth century, and this resulted in a decline in intellectual pursuits in the western part of Europe. By contrast, the Eastern Roman Empire (also known as the Byzantine Empire) resisted the attacks from the barbarians, and continued to advance various fields of learning, including physics.[17]

            In the sixth century Isidore of Miletus created an important compilation of Archimedes' works that are copied in the Archimedes Palimpsest.
            
            In sixth century Europe John Philoponus, a Byzantine scholar, questioned Aristotle's teaching of physics and noted its flaws. He introduced the theory of impetus. Aristotle's physics was not scrutinized until Philoponus appeared; unlike Aristotle, who based his physics on verbal argument, Philoponus relied on observation. On Aristotle's physics Philoponus wrote:
            
            But this is completely erroneous, and our view may be corroborated by actual observation more effectively than by any sort of verbal argument. For if you let fall from the same height two weights of which one is many times as heavy as the other, you will see that the ratio of the times required for the motion does not depend on the ratio of the weights, but that the difference in time is a very small one. And so, if the difference in the weights is not considerable, that is, of one is, let us say, double the other, there will be no difference, or else an imperceptible difference, in time, though the difference in weight is by no means negligible, with one body weighing twice as much as the other[18]
            
            Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics served as an inspiration for Galileo Galilei ten centuries later,[19] during the Scientific Revolution. Galileo cited Philoponus substantially in his works when arguing that Aristotelian physics was flawed.[20][21] In the 1300s Jean Buridan, a teacher in the faculty of arts at the University of Paris, developed the concept of impetus. It was a step toward the modern ideas of inertia and momentum.[22]
            
            Islamic scholarship inherited Aristotelian physics from the Greeks and during the Islamic Golden Age developed it further, especially placing emphasis on observation and a priori reasoning, developing early forms of the scientific method.
            
            The most notable innovations were in the field of optics and vision, which came from the works of many scientists like Ibn Sahl, Al-Kindi, Ibn al-Haytham, Al-Farisi and Avicenna. The most notable work was The Book of Optics (also known as Kitāb al-Manāẓir), written by Ibn al-Haytham, in which he conclusively disproved the ancient Greek idea about vision, but also came up with a new theory. In the book, he presented a study of the phenomenon of the camera obscura (his thousand-year-old version of the pinhole camera) and delved further into the way the eye itself works. Using dissections and the knowledge of previous scholars, he was able to begin to explain how light enters the eye. He asserted that the light ray is focused, but the actual explanation of how light projected to the back of the eye had to wait until 1604. His Treatise on Light explained the camera obscura, hundreds of years before the modern development of photography.[23]
            
            Ibn Al-Haytham (Alhazen) drawing
            Ibn al-Haytham (c. 965–c. 1040), Book of Optics Book I, [6.85], [6.86]. Book II, [3.80] describes his camera obscura experiments.[24]
            The seven-volume Book of Optics (Kitab al-Manathir) hugely influenced thinking across disciplines from the theory of visual perception to the nature of perspective in medieval art, in both the East and the West, for more than 600 years. Many later European scholars and fellow polymaths, from Robert Grosseteste and Leonardo da Vinci to René Descartes, Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton, were in his debt. Indeed, the influence of Ibn al-Haytham's Optics ranks alongside that of Newton's work of the same title, published 700 years later.
            
            The translation of The Book of Optics had a huge impact on Europe. From it, later European scholars were able to build devices that replicated those Ibn al-Haytham had built, and understand the way light works. From this, such important things as eyeglasses, magnifying glasses, telescopes, and cameras were developed.
            
            Classical physics

            Sir Isaac Newton (1643–1727), whose laws of motion and universal gravitation were major milestones in classical physics
            Physics became a separate science when early modern Europeans used experimental and quantitative methods to discover what are now considered to be the laws of physics.[25][page needed]
            
            Major developments in this period include the replacement of the geocentric model of the Solar System with the heliocentric Copernican model, the laws governing the motion of planetary bodies determined by Kepler between 1609 and 1619, pioneering work on telescopes and observational astronomy by Galileo in the 16th and 17th Centuries, and Newton's discovery and unification of the laws of motion and universal gravitation that would come to bear his name.[26] Newton also developed calculus,[d] the mathematical study of change, which provided new mathematical methods for solving physical problems.[27]
            
            The discovery of new laws in thermodynamics, chemistry, and electromagnetics resulted from greater research efforts during the Industrial Revolution as energy needs increased.[28] The laws comprising classical physics remain very widely used for objects on everyday scales travelling at non-relativistic speeds, since they provide a very close approximation in such situations, and theories such as quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity simplify to their classical equivalents at such scales. However, inaccuracies in classical mechanics for very small objects and very high velocities led to the development of modern physics in the 20th century.

            Max Planck (1858–1947), the originator of the theory of quantum mechanics
            
            Albert Einstein (1879–1955), whose work on the photoelectric effect and the theory of relativity led to a revolution in 20th century physics
            Modern physics began in the early 20th century with the work of Max Planck in quantum theory and Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. Both of these theories came about due to inaccuracies in classical mechanics in certain situations. Classical mechanics predicted a varying speed of light, which could not be resolved with the constant speed predicted by Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism; this discrepancy was corrected by Einstein's theory of special relativity, which replaced classical mechanics for fast-moving bodies and allowed for a constant speed of light.[29] Black-body radiation provided another problem for classical physics, which was corrected when Planck proposed that the excitation of material oscillators is possible only in discrete steps proportional to their frequency; this, along with the photoelectric effect and a complete theory predicting discrete energy levels of electron orbitals, led to the theory of quantum mechanics taking over from classical physics at very small scales.[30]
            
            Quantum mechanics would come to be pioneered by Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrödinger and Paul Dirac.[30] From this early work, and work in related fields, the Standard Model of particle physics was derived.[31] Following the discovery of a particle with properties consistent with the Higgs boson at CERN in 2012,[32] all fundamental particles predicted by the standard model, and no others, appear to exist; however, physics beyond the Standard Model, with theories such as supersymmetry, is an active area of research.[33] Areas of mathematics in general are important to this field, such as the study of probabilities and groups.</p>

  <h2>Navigation Menu</h2>
<p>In this example, we use CSS to style the list horizontally, to create a navigation menu:</p>

<ul id="ulid">
    <li id='liid'><a href="#Home">Home</a></li>
    <li id='liid'><a href="#News">News</a></li>
    <li id='liid'><a href="#Contact">contact</a></li>
    <li id='liid'><a href="#About">About</a></li>
    <li id='liid'><a href="#Sobuj is">Good Boy</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>An ordered HTML list</h2>

<ol type="i">
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol> 
<h2>The start attribute</h2>
<p>By default, an ordered list will start counting from 1. Use the start attribute to start counting from a specified number:</p>

<ol start="10">
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>

<ol type="I" start="10">
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol> 
<h2>A Nested List</h2>
<p>Lists can be nested (list inside list):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea
    <ol>
      <li>Black tea</li>
      <li>Green tea</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>

<h2>A Description List</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>Coffee</dt>
  <dd>- black hot drink</dd>
  <dt>Milk</dt>
  <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
</dl>

<div style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</div>

<p>The DIV element is a block element, and will always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>

<p>This is an inline span <span style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</span> element inside a paragraph.</p>

<p>The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>

</body>
</html>
